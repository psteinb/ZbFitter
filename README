0) To setup the package
   * setup root
   * setup tbb
   * source setupPATHS.sh in the parent directory of the package
   * source $SRC/makeAll.sh (I was too lazy to implement recursive building in GNUmake)

1) run the fits
see $SRC/results/central/do_3normalisations_top.sh or $SRC/results/central/do_1o3fractions_top.sh
for a fit on 3 templates plus the fixed top background taken from Sherpa_XXX.root

[FIXME: tbc.]


2) run pseudo experiments
see $SRC/results/ensemble/do_3normalisations_top.sh or $SRC/results/ensemble/do_1o3fractions_top.sh
for a fit on 3 templates plus the fixed top background taken from Sherpa_XXX.root
[watch out the pseudo experiments use different steering files from $SRC/results/environments/ as the fits in $SRC/results/central do]
[FIXME: tbc.]


3) run linearity tests
see *outdated* $SRC/results/linear/doThis.sh
tbc.
