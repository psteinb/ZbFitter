Before you start, try to contact me (Peter.Steinbach@tu-dresden.de) in order to discuss if you really want to use my software (it was never written to be used publically).

0) To setup the package
   * setup root
   * setup intel threading building blocks (tbb)
   * source setupPATHS.sh in the parent directory of the package
   * issue
     $> make && make runners
     from the top directory

1) run the fits
* source prepare.sh to create environment files as in $SRC/results/central/sherpa/SV0/*.sh
* see $SRC/results/central/*.sh 
for a fit on 3 templates plus the fixed top background taken from Sherpa_XXX.root
* if goodness-of-fit information is needed, run the fit with options -P <fileLocation> (and -m 1) and the respective root file from a pseudo experiment (this contains the maxLLH distribution to
calculate the p-value from)

2) run pseudo experiments
* source prepare.sh to create environment files as in $SRC/results/ensemble/sherpa/SV0/
* see e.g. $SRC/results/ensemble/sherpa/SV0/do_*.sh
  for a fit on 3 templates plus the fixed top background taken from Sherpa_XXX.root

3) systematics
* generate the input files as documented in the respective directory $SRC/bundles/sherpa/SV0/systematics
* perform the fits as documented in $SRC/results/systematics

4) run linearity tests
see $SRC/results/linear/
* due to technical reasons there are 2 approaches implemented 
--> generate the input files using n variants of a given distribution
--> conduct pseudo experiments with all n variants
--> collect the mean and the average fit uncertainty

5) Have Fun!
